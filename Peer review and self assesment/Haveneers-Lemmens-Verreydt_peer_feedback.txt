Q25:   [ 1] explanation: [This could be contained in “configurations” but isn’t explained elsewhere.]
Q26:   [ 1] explanation: [Customer organisations can be subscribed to 0..* applications, but again this depends on how “configurations” is defined. ]
Q27:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q28:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q29:   [ 2] explanation: [This can be derived from the “location” attribute.]

Q66:   [ 2]
Q66explanation: [
A lot of key concepts are missing in our opinion (based on their use cases).
Most links are modelled incorrectly, which has a negative impact on the readability and the correlation with the assignment.
]
Q67:   [ 3]
Q67explanation: [
Relevant information is covered but most of the time very brief.
This makes some use cases unclear or vague. Some of the use cases are (in our opinion) unnecessary. e.g. Use case 8: Get upload progress
]
Q68:   [ 4]
Q68explanation: [
Overall they were good however some concepts used are not mentioned anywhere else.
]
Q69:   [ 3]
Q69explanation: [
The report is fairly easy to read and navigate. The domain model however was difficult to read and analyse due to misuse of UML arrows.
The report covers the most important parts, but is sometimes too concise.
Throughout the report there were some minor inconsistencies.
]
% Questions 70-71 are open questions.
Q70:   [
No, there are a lot of missing concepts. Some relevant aspects are to vaguely covered (topology, development environment, different types of message types …).
]
Q71:   [
Try using the correct UML syntax. Try to elaborate more on certain key parts of the assignment.
We really had the idea that the 3 parts of the assignment were made by 3 different people. We think that working together would solve many inconsistencies.
